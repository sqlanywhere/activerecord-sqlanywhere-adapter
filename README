=SQL Anywhere ActiveRecord Driver

This is a SQL Anywhere driver for Ruby ActiveRecord. This driver requires the
native SQL Anywhere Ruby driver. To get the native driver, use:

   gem install sqlanywhere

This driver is designed for use with ActiveRecord 2.0.2 and greater.

This driver is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.

==Making a Connection

The following code is a sample database configuration object.

  ActiveRecord::Base.configurations = {
    'arunit' => {
      :adapter  => 'sqlanywhere', 
      :database => 'arunit',      #equivalent to the "DatabaseName" parameter
      :server   => 'arunit',      #equivalent to the "ServerName" parameter
      :username => 'dba',         #equivalent to the "UserID" parameter
      :password => 'sql',         #equivalent to the "Password" parameter
      :commlinks => 'TCPIP()',    #equivalent to the "Commlinks" parameter
      :connection_name => 'Rails' #equivalent to the "ConnectionName" parameter
  }

==Running the ActiveRecord Unit Test Suite

1. Open <tt><ACTIVERECORD_INSTALL_DIR>/rakefile</tt> and modify the line:

      for adapter in %w( mysql postgresql sqlite sqlite3 firebird db2 oracle sybase openbase frontbase )

   to include <tt>sqlanywhere</tt>. It should now look like:

      for adapter in %w( mysql postgresql sqlite sqlite3 firebird db2 oracle sybase openbase frontbase sqlanywhere )

2. Create directory to hold the connection definition:
   
      mkdir <ACTIVERECORD_INSTALL_DIR>/test/connections/native_sqlanywhere

3. Copy <tt>test/connection.rb</tt> into the newly created directory.

   NOTE: If using ActiveRecord 2.0.2, change the second line of the file from:
  
      require_dependency 'models/course'

   to:

      require_dependency 'fixtures/course'

4. Create the two test databases. These can be created in any directory.

      dbinit -c arunit
      dbinit -c arunit2
      dbsrv11 arunit arunit2

   <b>If the commands cannot be found, make sure you have set up the SQL Anywhere environment variables correctly.</b> For more information review the online documentation here[http://dcx.sybase.com/index.php#http%3A%2F%2Fdcx.sybase.com%2F1100en%2Fdbadmin_en11%2Fda-envvar-sect1-3672410.html].

5. If you are using ActiveRecord 2.0.2, you must load the test tables. 

      dbisql -c "eng=arunit;dbn=arunit;uid=dba;pwd=sql" sqlanywhere.sql
      dbisql -c "eng=arunit;dbn=arunit2;uid=dba;pwd=sql" sqlanywhere2.sql

   If you are using a newer version of ActiveRecord, this schema is automatically
   migrated for you.

6. Run the unit test suite from the ActiveRecord install directory:

      rake test_sqlanywhere

   <b>If the migration tests fail, make sure you have set up the SQL Anywhere environment variables correctly.</b> For more information review the online documentation here[http://dcx.sybase.com/index.php#http%3A%2F%2Fdcx.sybase.com%2F1100en%2Fdbadmin_en11%2Fda-envvar-sect1-3672410.html].

==Explaination of Test Results

As of ActiveRecord 2.2.2., it is expected that 6 tests will fail. The failed tests, along with an explaination, are identified below:

1. (CalculationsTest) - test_should_sum_expression

   Explaination: Appears to be an error in the test.
   
   This tests checks the results of the following statement:
   
      assert_equal '636', Account.sum("2 * credit_limit")
   
   According to the ActiveRecord documentation, the summation of a column should return a value of the same type as the column. In this case, <tt>credit_limit</tt> is an integer, and so the result should be a number type, not a string.
   
2. (MigrationTest) - test_add_table_with_decimals

   Explaination: Requires special case.

   From the comments regarding this test:

      # This one is fun. The 'value_of_e' field is defined as 'DECIMAL' with
      # precision/scale explicitly left out.  By the SQL standard, numbers
      # assigned to this field should be truncated but that's seldom respected.
   
   There are already three special cases of this test. SQL Anywhere would require another special case to pass this test.

3. (NamedScopeTest) - test_should_use_where_in_query_for_named_scope

   Explaination: Appears to be an error in the test.

   This test issues a query that returns two rows. Because there is no ORDER BY in the query, the order that that rows are returned in is non-deterministic. SQL Anywhere returns the correct rows, but in a different order.

4. (QueryCacheTest) - test_cache_does_not_wrap_string_results_in_arrays

   Explaination: Appears to be an error in the test.

   This tests checks that the cached value of the following query is a string:

      SELECT count(*) AS count_all FROM tasks

   However, SQL Anywhere treats the values of a <tt>COUNT(*)</tt> opration as a fixnum, not a string. It would appear that the real intent of this test is to test that the value is NOT an array, rather than testing that the value is a string.

5. (SchemaDumperTest) - test_schema_dump_includes_limit_constraint_for_integer_columns

   Explaination: SQL Anywhere does not have a 'limitless' integer type.

   Any integer type will be given an implicit limit when instantiated. It would be possible to use another type such as <tt>NUMERIC</tt> to mimic this type, however this seems like a bad idea.

6. (ValidationsTest) - test_validate_case_sensitive_uniqueness

   Explaination: By default, SQL Anywhere is case insensitive.

   If a case sensitive database is required (as in this test), ensure the database is created with the <tt>-c</tt> switch to make it case sensitive.
